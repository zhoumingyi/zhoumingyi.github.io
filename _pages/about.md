Prior to joining Monash University, I worked with [Prof. Yipeng Liu](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/yipengliu/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Ce Zhu](https://www.avc2-lab.net/~eczhu/) in UESTC from 2017 to 2021.

My current research interests include SE4AI, AI4SE, mobile software engineering, AI security, program analysis and computer vision, especially for the on-device AI security and efficiency. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
